# React App - Unspoiled

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Pitch:
The aim of this web application is to alleviate the struggle of using groceries <em>before</em> they spoil. The application will allow a user to submit a list of items purchased at the grocery store and create an inventory of all grocery items owned. The user can view all items available and remove items as they are used. The user can add items to a shopping list as needed. The user can sort by different criteria, including a sort by spoil-by date to ensure the items are used <em>before</em> they spoil. The user can add recipes to a collection and see all recipes in the collection along with which ingredients they have for those recipes.
